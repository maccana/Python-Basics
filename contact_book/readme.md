# 📝 Contact Book CLI — Python Practice Project

This project is a beginner-friendly command-line contact book built in Python. It allows users to add, view, search, and delete contacts interactively.

## 🚀 Purpose

Designed as part of a foundational Python learning program, this project reinforces core programming concepts in a practical, hands-on way.

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

- **Variables & Input Handling**  
  Capturing user input and storing data dynamically.

- **Control Flow**  
  Using `if`, `elif`, and `else` to guide program logic.

- **Loops**  
  Implementing a `while True` loop to create a persistent menu system.

- **Dictionaries**  
  Storing and managing contact data using key-value pairs.

- **Error Handling** *(optional extension)*  
  Can be expanded to include `try/except` blocks for input validation.

- **Modular Thinking**  
  Encourages breaking down tasks into manageable actions (Add, View, Search, Delete).

## 📦 Features

- Add new contacts
- View all saved contacts
- Search for a contact by name
- Delete a contact
- Menu-driven interface with continuous loop until user quits

## 🛠️ How to Run

Make sure you have Python installed, then run:

```bash
python contact_book.py
